## This restricts the file permissions of the 'sudo' executable so that a vulnerability
## in the program will not be exploitable by any users not in the "sysmaint" group. 'sudo'
## is a very complex program and is 'setuid' so vulnerabilities in it can allow privilege
## escalation, regardless of other root access restrictions. For example, the following
## buffer overflow vulnerability could have been exploited by any user on the system:
## https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/01/26/3
## With this restriction, only users explicitly permitted to use 'sysmaint' by being added to
## the "sysmaint" group could exploit such vulnerabilities. For example, this would prevent a
## compromised network-facing daemon (such as web servers, time synchronization daemons,
## etc.) running as its own user from exploiting 'sudo' to escalate privileges.
/usr/bin/sudo 4750 root sysmaint

/usr/bin/pkexec 4750 root sysmaint

## '/usr/lib/policykit-1/polkit-agent-helper-1'
## - is a symlink to: '../polkit-1/polkit-agent-helper-1'
## - real path is: '/usr/lib/polkit-1/polkit-agent-helper-1'
##
## See also:
## /usr/lib/permission-hardener.d/25_default_whitelist_policykit.conf
/usr/lib/polkit-1/polkit-agent-helper-1 4750 root sysmaint

## 'su' is already handled by permission-hardener default.
## 'su' does not have a whitelist entry by permission-hardener default.
## As a result...
##
## chmod-calc /usr/bin/su
##
## Owner: root
## Group: root
## Octal Permissions: 744

## Category   Read   Write  Execute
## Owner      Yes    Yes    Yes
## Group      Yes    No     No
## Public     Yes    No     No
##
## In summary:
## - 'su' is no longer SUID.
## - Group and public lack permission to execute it.
## - Therefore 'su' does not require a special mention in this file.
